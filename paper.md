# Introduction

Large networks allow to learn complex relationships. Although they overfit
easily if the training set is small because there is a lot of parameters to
learn.

Convolutional networks offer a great reduction of parameters on regular
Euclidean domain. This work proposes to generalize it to the discrete model of
manifolds, graphs. Such an approach was proposed by [@bruna_spectral_2013;
@henaff_deep_2015], we will refine it with proper graph signal processing tools.

# Method

## Spectral graph theory

A graph $\G = (\V, \E, \W)$ is defined by a set $V$ of $|V| = M$ nodes and a set
$E$ of weighted edges. The connectivity of the graph is captured by the
adjacency matrix $W \in \R^{M \times M}$ which entry $W_{i,j}$ denotes the
weight of the edge $(v_i, v_j) \in E$ which connects the vertex $v_i \in V$ to
$v_j \in V$. It is set to $0$ if the vertices are not connected, i.e. $(v_i,
v_j) \notin E$. Assuming an undirected graph, $W$ is a symmetric matrix.
A graph signal is any signal $x \in \R^M$ defined on the vertices of $G$.

The combinatorial graph Laplacian is defined as
$$ \L^c := D - W \in \R^{M \times M} $$
where $D \in \R^{M \times M}$ is the diagonal degree matrix defined as
$D_{i,i} := \sum_j W_{i,j}$. Note that it is a difference operator such that
$$ (\L^c x)_i = \sum_j W_{i,j} (x_i - x_j). $$
The normalized graph Laplacian is defined as
$$ \L^n := I_M - D^{-1/2} W D^{-1/2} \in \R^{M \times M} $$
where $I_M \in \R^{M \times M}$ is the identity matrix. Finally, the
random-walk graph Laplacian is defined as
$$ \L^{rw} := I_M - D^{-1} W \in \R^{M \times M}. $$
Note that our work is independent to the chosen graph Laplacian.

In analogy to the real line Fourier Transform, a Fourier basis is given by the
eigenvectors of the Laplacian
$$ \L u_i = \lambda_i u_i \st \norm{u_i}_2=1, \ i = 0, \ldots, M-1, $$
with their associated eigenvalues $\lambda_i$. Assuming the graph is connected,
we may order the vector $\lambda := [\lambda_0, \ldots, \lambda_{M-1}]^T \in
\R^M$ of eigenvalues such that
$$ 0 = \lambda_0 < \lambda_1 \leq \ldots \leq \lambda_{M-1} = \lambda_{max}. $$
As the Laplacian is a real symmetric matrix, the eigenvalues are real and the
eigenvectors orthonormal. The Laplacian is indeed diagonalized by the Fourier
basis $U := [u_0, \ldots, u_{M-1}] \in \R^{M \times M}$ such that
$$ \L = U \Lambda U^T $$ {#eq:lap_diag}
where $\Lambda := \diag(\lambda) \in \R^{M \times M}$ denotes a diagonal matrix
of eigenvalues and $U^T$ is the matrix transpose of $U$. See
[@chung_spectral_1997] for details on spectral graph theory.

The Graph Fourier Transform $\hat{x} \in \R^M$ of any graph signal $x$ is
given by
$$ \hat{x} = U^T x =
[\langle u_0, x \rangle, \ldots, \langle u_{M-1}, x \rangle]^T $$
where $\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle$ denotes an inner product
[@shuman_emerging_2013]. The inverse transform is then given by
$$ x = U \hat{x}. $$

It follows that any signal $\hat{x}$ can be filtered in the spectral domain by
$$ \hat{y} = g_\theta(\Lambda) \hat{x} $$
where the operator $g_\theta(\Lambda) \in \R^{M \times M}$ is a diagonal matrix
of $M$ Fourier coefficients parametrized by $\theta$. The filtering operation
can equivalently take place in the vertex domain as
$$ y = U g_\theta(\Lambda) U^T x = g_\theta(\L) x $$
where the matrix function $g_\theta(\L) = U g_\theta(\Lambda) U^T \in \R^{M
\times M}$ is akin to a convolution on the vertices.

## Graph filter learning

Given a graph $G$, a set $X = [x_0, \ldots, x_{N-1}] \in \R^{M \times N}$ of
$N$ source graph signals of dimensionality $M$ and their associated set $Y
= [y_0, \ldots, y_{N-1}] \in \R^{M \times N}$ of target signals, we want to
learn the parameters $\theta \in \R^M$ of a graph filter $g_\theta(\Lambda) :=
\diag(\theta)$ such as to minimize the convex mean square error
$$ L =
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \norm{ g_\theta(\L) x_i - y_i }_2^2 =
\frac{1}{N} \norm{ U \diag(\theta) U^T X - Y }_F^2 $$ {#eq:loss}
where $\norm{\cdot}_2^2$ denotes the squared $\ell_2$ norm and
$\norm{\cdot}_F^2$ the squared Frobenius norm.

Note that, while being the most flexible definition of $g_\theta(\Lambda)$, the
independence of the Fourier coefficients $\theta$ from the eigenvalues
$\Lambda$ does omit all information about frequencies. As we know that the
lower frequencies are more important for clustering [ref NCut], we could have
designed a parametric filter with less parameters.

Rewriting [@eq:loss] in the spectral domain while decomposing it w.r.t. the
scalar coefficients $\theta_i$ gives
$$ L =
\frac{1}{N} \norm{ \diag(\theta) U^T X - U^T Y }_F^2 =
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \norm{\theta_i\Xh_{i,\cdot} - \Yh_{i,\cdot}}_2^2 $$
where $\Xh = U^TX \in \R^{M \times N}$ and $\Yh = U^TY \in \R^{M \times N}$ are
the spectral representations of the signals $X$ and $Y$. The gradient for each
coefficient is then given by
$$ \nabla_{\theta_i} L =
\frac{2}{N} ( \theta_i \Xh_{i,\cdot} - \Yh_{i,\cdot} ) \Xh^T_{\cdot,i} $$
and can be rewritten in a vectorized form as
$$ \nabla_{\theta} L =
\frac{2}{N} \diag \left( (\diag(\theta) \Xh - \Yh) \Xh^T \right) =
\frac{2}{N} \left( ( \theta 1_N^T \odot \Xh - \Yh ) \odot \Xh \right) 1_N
$$ {#eq:gradient}
where $1_N$ denotes a unit vector of length $N$ and $\odot$ the element-wise
Hadamard product. The second form avoids the computation of the useless
off-diagonal elements.

A closed-form solution is given by the optimality condition
$\nabla_{\theta}L=0$ such that
$$ \theta^* = \argmin_\theta L =
(\Xh \odot \Yh) 1_N \oslash (\Xh \odot \Xh) 1_N $$ {#eq:direct}
where $\oslash$ denotes an element-wise division. Note that this method is
impractical for large $M$ and $N$ (sufficiently large for $X$ and $Y$ to not
fit in memory). A \gls{SGD} based on [@eq:gradient] will do the trick.

There is however two major computational drawbacks to this optimization
process: (1) the Fourier transform $\Xh=U^TX$ of a set of signals costs
$O(M^2N)$ operations and (2) the eigenvalue decomposition
$\L = U \Lambda U^T$ costs $O(M^3)$. The total cost of filtering is thus
$O(M^2 \max(M,N))$, a problem already stated in [@henaff_deep_2015].

### Chebyshev approximation

The idea is to approximate (in the spectral domain) the filter by a truncated
Chebyshev expansion and to recursively compute the Chebyshev polynomials from
the Laplacian, avoiding the Fourier basis altogether. This approximate method
for spectral graph filtering was first proposed in [@hammond_wavelets_2011] for
the wavelet transform on graphs.

Recall that the Chebyshev polynomial $T_k(x)$ of order $k$ may be generated by
the stable recurrence relation $T_k(x) = 2x T_{k-1}(x) - T_{k-2}(x)$ with $T_0
= 1$ and $T_1 = x$. These polynomials form an orthogonal basis for $L^2([-1,1],
dy / \sqrt{1-y^2})$, the Hilbert space of square integrable functions with
respect to a measure.

The graph filter $g_\theta(\Lambda)$ can thus be constructed from the truncated
expansion
$$ g_\theta(\Lambda) := \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \theta_k T_k(\tilde{\Lambda}) $$
of polynomial order $K-1$, where the parameter $\theta \in \R^K$ is a vector of
Chebyshev coefficients and $T_k(\tilde{\Lambda}) \in \R^{M \times M}$ is the
Chebyshev polynomial of order $k$ evaluated at $\tilde{\Lambda} := 2 \Lambda
/ \lambda_{max} - I_M \in \R^{M \times M}$, a diagonal matrix of scaled
eigenvalues (so that they lie in $[-1,1]$). While reducing the number of
parameters from $M$ to $K$, this parametrization enforces smoothness in the
spectral domain, which translates to localization in the vertex domain. This is
often a desired property.

The trick to avoid the Fourier basis $U$ is to express the polynomials as
functions of the Laplacian $\L$ instead of its eigenvalues $\Lambda$ using
[@eq:lap_diag], such that the filtering operator in the vertex domain is given
by
$$ g_\theta(\L) = U g_\theta(\Lambda) U^T =
\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} U \theta_k T_k(\tilde{\Lambda}) U^T =
\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \theta_k T_k(\tilde{\L}) $$ {#eq:chebyshev}
where $T_k(\tilde{\L}) \in \R^{M \times M}$ is the Chebyshev polynomial of
order $k$ evaluated at the scaled Laplacian $\tilde{\L} := 2 \L / \lambda_{max}
- I_M$. Note that the spectrum of the normalized Laplacian is bounded by $2$,
such that the scaling can simply be $\tilde{\L} = \L - I_M$, tolerating some
imprecision in the approximation.

Inserting [@eq:chebyshev] into [@eq:loss] we obtain
$$ L =
\frac{1}{N} \norm{ \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \theta_k T_k(\tilde{\L}) X - Y }_F^2 =
\frac{1}{N} \norm{ \bar{X} \theta - \bar{y} }_2^2 $$
where $\bar{y} \in \R^{MN}$ is the vectorized matrix $Y$ and the $k^\text{th}$
column of $\bar{X} \in \R^{MN \times K}$ is the vectorized matrix $\tilde{X}_k
:= T_k(\tilde{\L}) X \in \R^{M \times N}$. The gradient is then given by
$$ \nabla_\theta L =
\frac{2}{N} \bar{X}^T (\bar{X} \theta - \bar{y}). $$ {#eq:gradient_c}

While the system is largely over-determined as $K << MN$, a closed-form
solution is given by the optimality condition $\nabla_\theta L = 0$ so that
$$ \theta^* = \argmin_\theta L = \bar{X}^+ \bar{y} $$ {#eq:direct_c}
where $\bar{X}^+ = (\bar{X}^T\bar{X})^{-1} \bar{X}^T$ is the pseudo-inverse of
$\bar{X}$. The computation of the inverse is fast and stable for small $K$.
Alternative approximate solution methods for larger orders include the
computation of the pseudo-inverse with \gls{SVD}, the use of a least-square
solver or a gradient descent scheme based on [@eq:gradient_c].

Using the recurrence
$$ \tilde{X}_k = 2\tilde{\L} \tilde{X}_{k-1} - \tilde{X}_{k-2} $$
with $\tilde{X}_0 = X$ and $\tilde{X}_1 = \tilde{\L} X$, the computation of
$\bar{X}$ given $X$ costs $O(K|E|N) = O(KMN)$ operations if the number of edges
$|E|$ is proportional to the number of nodes $M$, e.g. for kNN graphs. As the
cost of the product $\bar{X}\theta$ is similar, the entire filtering operation
has a computational cost of $O(KMN)$ whereas the straightforward implementation
using the Fourier basis had a cost of $O(M^2\max(M,N)$. To further save
computations, at the expense of memory, one may store $\bar{X}$ while applying
different filters, e.g. in the case of learning through \gls{SGD}.
